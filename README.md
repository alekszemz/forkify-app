<p>The <strong>"Forkify"</strong> application is designed to help users find and discover new recipes to cook. The primary feature of the app is the <strong>search bar</strong>, where users can type in the name of a specific ingredient (such as "pasta") and then click the search button or press enter to see a list of relevant recipes.</p>
<p>The results of the search are displayed in the <strong>left column</strong> of the user interface, where up to <strong>ten recipes</strong> are shown at a time. Users can navigate through the results by clicking the <strong>"next" button</strong> to see the next ten recipes, and so on. Additionally, the app allows users to <strong>"bookmark" their favorite recipes</strong>, which will then be saved and appear in the <strong>top right corner</strong> of the user interface, in the <strong>"bookmark panel."</strong></p>
<p>For those who want to share their own recipe, the app also has a feature that allows users to <strong>upload their own recipe</strong>, and customize the ingredient quantities. All the changes made by the user will be saved in the <strong>local storage</strong>, so they will not be gone after you refresh the page.</p>
<p>This project was created by following the <strong>"The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!"</strong> on the <strong>Udemy</strong> platform, taught by <strong>Jonas Schmedtmann</strong>.
