So this application is all about searching for recipes and displaying them on the user interface. To start work with this app you need to type in the search bar for any product (for example pasta) and click the search button or enter. Then in the left column, you will get ten recipes and below recipes, you will see a button to go forward to the next ten recipes in so on. You can bookmark recipes and they will appear on the bookmark panel (top right corner) or you can upload your own recipe. You can increase or decrease recipe ingredients and all this are saved in local storage so they will not be gone after you refresh the page. This project was created through learning Jonas Schmedtmann course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!" on the Udemy platform.
